# chatterbox

ChatterBox is an open source tool for companies to talk inject into the website.  The setup is easy, a one line script plugin and you're set!

ChatterBox also helps track any form inputs (users may type a form halfway and forget, ChatterBox will track this data for you)

ChatterBox uses the lattest real time technologies such as websockets.
